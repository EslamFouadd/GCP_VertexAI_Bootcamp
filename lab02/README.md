# Lab: Vertex AI: Hyperparameter Tuning

In this lab, you will use Vertex AI to run a hyperparameter tuning job for a TensorFlow model.

# Overview
In this lab, you learn how to use Vertex AI to run a hyperparameter tuning job for a TensorFlow model. While this lab uses TensorFlow for the model code, you could easily replace it with another framework.

# Learning objectives
Modify training application code for hyperparameter tuning.

Launch a hyperparameter tuning job from the Vertex AI UI.
