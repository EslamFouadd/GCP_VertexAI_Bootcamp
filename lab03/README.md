# Lab: Vertex AI Model Monitoring

Model monitoring is the close tracking of the performance of ML models in production so that production and AI teams can identify potential issues before they impact the business.

# Overview
Model monitoring is the close tracking of the performance of ML models in production so that production and AI teams can identify potential issues before they affect the business.

If production traffic differs from training data or varies substantially over time, the quality of the answers your model produces is probably affected. When that happens, you will want to be alerted automatically and responsively so that you can anticipate problems before they affect your customer experiences or your revenue streams.

# Objectives
Deploy a pre-trained model.

Configure model monitoring.

Generate some artificial traffic.

Interpret the data reported by the model monitoring feature.
